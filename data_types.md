# Python Data Types

In Python, **data types** are the different kinds of values you can work with. Think of it like this: just like different things in the world have different types (like books, chairs, or apples), data in Python also comes in different types.

---

## 1. **String (Text)**
A **string** is simply a piece of text. Anything inside quotation marks (either single or double) is considered a string in Python.

### Example:
```python
"Hello, World!"
'Python is fun!'
```

- **Use Case**: Strings are used for things like names, addresses, or any other kind of text.

---

## 2. **Integer (Whole Number)**
An **integer** is a whole number, meaning it doesn’t have a decimal point. It can be positive or negative.

### Example:
```python
42
-10
1000
```

- **Use Case**: Integers are used for counting or calculations, like how many apples are in a basket.

---

## 3. **Float (Decimal Number)**
A **float** is a number that has a decimal point. Floats are used when you need more precision than just whole numbers.

### Example:
```python
3.14
-0.5
100.0
```

- **Use Case**: Floats are useful for things like prices, measurements, or anything that involves fractions.

---

## 4. **Boolean (True or False)**
A **boolean** is a value that can only be one of two things: `True` or `False`. Think of it like a light switch that can either be on (`True`) or off (`False`).

### Example:
```python
True
False
```

- **Use Case**: Booleans are used to make decisions in your code, like checking if a condition is met.

---

## 5. **List (A Collection of Items)**
A **list** is like a shopping list. It’s a way to store multiple pieces of data (or "items") together. You can mix different data types in a list (like having strings and numbers together).

### Example:
```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[42, "hello", 3.14]
```

- **Use Case**: Lists are helpful when you want to group items together, like storing a list of names or numbers.

---

## 6. **Dictionary (Pairs of Items)**
A **dictionary** is like a real dictionary, where every word has a definition. In Python, a dictionary pairs two things together: a **key** (like a word) and a **value** (like the definition). These key-value pairs let you store data that is related.

### Example:
```python
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

- **Use Case**: Dictionaries are used when you want to connect related information, like a person's name with their age or city.

---

## 7. **None (No Value)**
`None` represents the absence of a value. It’s like saying “nothing” or “no answer.”

### Example:
```python
None
```

- **Use Case**: You use `None` when you want to show that something doesn’t have a value yet or it’s unknown.

---

## Summary
- **String**: Text (like "Hello")
- **Integer**: Whole numbers (like 42)
- **Float**: Decimal numbers (like 3.14)
- **Boolean**: True or False (like a yes/no answer)
- **List**: A collection of items (like a shopping list)
- **Dictionary**: A pair of related items (like a word and its definition)
- **None**: No value (like saying "nothing")

These data types help Python know how to handle and work with different types of information!
