1. **int**: This is used for integers, which are whole numbers without any decimal point. For example, `int age = 25;`.

2. **float**: This is used for floating-point numbers, which are numbers that can have a fractional part (decimals). For example, `float temperature = 98.6;`.

3. **double**: Similar to `float`, but it can hold larger numbers and more decimal places. For example, `double bigDecimal = 12345.6789;`.

4. **char**: This is used for single characters, like a letter or a symbol. It's enclosed in single quotes. For example, `char grade = 'A';`.

5. **void**: This is used as a return type for functions that don't return a value. It doesn't hold any data itself.

Additionally, there are variants of int and float types:

- **short** and **long**: These specify variations in the size of integers. A `short` is generally smaller, while a `long` can store larger numbers. For example, `short int smallNumber;` or `long int largeNumber;`.
  
- **long long**: For even larger integers than `long`. For example, `long long int veryLargeNumber;`.

- **unsigned**: This modifier is used with integer types to store only non-negative numbers (no negative values). For example, `unsigned int positiveNumber;`.
