# Python Basics for Data Science

## 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in data science, web development, automation, and more.

### Key Terms:
- **High-level Language**: A programming language that is closer to human languages and abstracts away most of the machine-level details.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, which means it doesn't need to be compiled before running. This makes debugging easier but can sometimes make it slower compared to compiled languages like C++ (Python code is run directly by the computer, line by line, without needing to be prepared beforehand. This makes finding mistakes easier, but can also make it run slower than some other programming languages.).

### Why Python for Data Science?
- **Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is simple and readable, making it a great language for beginners.
- **Rich Libraries**: Python has a vast collection of libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` that make data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning easy.
- **Community Support**: Python has a large, active community, which means a wealth of resources and libraries are available to help with data science tasks.

### Printing Output
In Python, you can use the `print()` function to display output.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
